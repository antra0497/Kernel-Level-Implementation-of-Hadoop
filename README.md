# R-D-Kernel-Level-Implementation-of-Hadoop

Hadoop is an Apache open source framework written in Java that allows distributed processing of large
datasets across clusters of computers using simple programming models in a distributed computing
environment. The kernel is the essential center of a computer operating system. It acts as an interface
between the user applications and the hardware. The sole aim of the kernel is to manage the
communication between the software (user level applications) and the hardware (CPU, disk memory
etc.). Hadoop works on application layer so the motive of this research is to find:

• Why it cannot be implemented at kernel level
• What are the difficulties faced?
• And try to implement it on android platform.
• Finding solution to the encounter problems if possible.
